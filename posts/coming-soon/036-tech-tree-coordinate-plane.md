## Core Concepts

- -Ordered pair (x,y): an ordered two-number label that uniquely identifies a point in the plane (order matters)
- -Cartesian reference frame: two perpendicular number lines (x-axis and y-axis) with a chosen origin and unit scale that set horizontal and vertical directions

## Key Symbols & Notation

Ordered-pair notation: (x,y)sqrt(...) and caret ^ for powers (e.g., sqrt(...) and ^2 for squaring)

## Essential Relationships

- -Point-to-coordinate mapping: each geometric point corresponds to exactly one ordered pair (x,y) in the Cartesian frame
- -Distance formula: Euclidean distance between (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)

### Teaching Strategy

Almost every picture in calculus—curves, tangents, areas, motion—starts with one simple idea: you can label locations with numbers. Coordinate systems are the bridge between geometry (shapes) and algebra (equations).

TL;DR:

A Cartesian coordinate system uses two perpendicular number lines (x-axis and y-axis) with an origin (0,0). A point is labeled by an ordered pair (x,y): x tells horizontal position, y tells vertical position. You can plot points by moving x then y, and you can measure straight-line distance with the distance formula: √((x₂−x₁)² + (y₂−y₁)²).

## What Is a Coordinate System?

### Why we need coordinates (motivation)

Geometry is great at describing shapes, but it can be hard to *compute* with shapes directly. Algebra is great at computation, but it needs numbers.

A coordinate system is a way to translate geometry into numbers:

- •A *point* (a location) becomes a pair of numbers.
- •A *curve* becomes an equation like y = x².
- •A *motion* becomes changing coordinates over time, like (x(t), y(t)).

This translation is what makes calculus possible: limits, slopes (derivatives), and areas (integrals) all rely on turning pictures into precise numeric relationships.

### The Cartesian coordinate plane

The most common coordinate system in early math and calculus is the **Cartesian coordinate system**.

It has:

1) A horizontal number line called the **x-axis**

2) A vertical number line called the **y-axis**

3) They intersect at a special point called the **origin**

The origin is labeled:

- •(0,0)

The axes are **perpendicular** (meet at a right angle). You also choose a **unit scale** (what “1” means on each axis). Usually the scale is the same on both axes.

### Points as ordered pairs

A point in the plane is labeled by an **ordered pair**:

- •(x,y)

**Order matters.** The first number is the x-coordinate (horizontal), the second is the y-coordinate (vertical).

If you accidentally swap them, you get a different point:

- •(2,5) ≠ (5,2)

### Intuition: “how far, then how far”

Think of (x,y) as instructions starting from the origin:

1) Move x units along the x-axis (right if x > 0, left if x < 0)

2) Then move y units parallel to the y-axis (up if y > 0, down if y < 0)

That final location is the point (x,y).

### Quadrants

The x-axis and y-axis divide the plane into four regions called **quadrants**:

| Quadrant | x sign | y sign | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I | + | + | (3,2) |
| II | − | + | (−3,2) |
| III | − | − | (−3,−2) |
| IV | + | − | (3,−2) |

Knowing the quadrant helps you quickly sanity-check a plotted point.

### Key symbols in this node

You’ll use:

- •Ordered-pair notation: (x,y)
- •Square root: √(…)
- •Squaring: ^2 (like (x₂−x₁)^2)

These appear immediately in the distance formula and later everywhere in calculus.

## Core Mechanic 1: Plotting Points and Reading Coordinates

### Why plotting matters

Plotting points is the simplest form of “graphing data.” Before you graph whole functions like y = x², you learn to place individual points. This skill becomes:

- •making scatter plots (data)
- •sketching function graphs (calculus)
- •interpreting derivatives as slopes at points

### How to plot a point (step-by-step)

To plot (x,y):

1) Start at the origin (0,0)

2) Move horizontally to x

3) Move vertically to y

4) Mark the point

It is important that the *horizontal move comes from x* and the *vertical move comes from y*.

### Reading a point from a graph

If you see a point marked on a coordinate plane, you reverse the process:

1) Look at how far it is from the y-axis horizontally → that is x

2) Look at how far it is from the x-axis vertically → that is y

A helpful mental check: if the point is to the left of the y-axis, x should be negative. If it is below the x-axis, y should be negative.

### Axes, intercepts, and special cases

Some points sit directly on an axis.

- •On the x-axis: y = 0, so points look like (x,0)
- •Example: (4,0)
- •On the y-axis: x = 0, so points look like (0,y)
- •Example: (0,−3)

The origin (0,0) is on both axes.

### A coordinate system is a *reference frame*

A subtle but important idea: coordinates depend on the chosen axes and origin.

If you shift the origin or rotate axes, the same geometric point could get different numeric coordinates. In this node we assume the standard setup:

- •perpendicular axes
- •origin at (0,0)
- •positive x to the right, positive y upward

This “frame” is what lets different people agree on the same location using numbers.

### Coordinate vs. point

People sometimes say “the coordinate (3,−1).” More precisely:

- •The **point** is the geometric location.
- •The **coordinates** are the numbers (3,−1) used to label it in a chosen coordinate system.

This distinction becomes useful later with transformations (shifts, scalings) and with vectors.

### Mini-connection to vectors

Soon you’ll meet vectors like **v** = ⟨x,y⟩. In 2D, the numbers are the same ingredients as coordinates, but the interpretation changes:

- •(x,y) usually means a *location* (a point)
- •⟨x,y⟩ often means a *displacement* (a direction and distance)

For now, focus on points. Just keep in mind that the same pair of numbers can play different roles.

## Core Mechanic 2: Distance on the Coordinate Plane (Distance Formula)

### Why distance needs a formula

Once points are labeled with numbers, you want to measure geometric quantities numerically. The first and most important measurement is **straight-line distance** between two points.

In calculus, distance appears in many places:

- •measuring error between an approximation and a true value
- •measuring how far an input x is from a point a when computing limits
- •describing circles: all points at a fixed distance r from a center

So we want a distance formula that uses only coordinates.

### Start from what you already know: the Pythagorean theorem

Suppose you have two points:

- •P₁ = (x₁, y₁)
- •P₂ = (x₂, y₂)

If you draw the right triangle formed by moving horizontally from P₁ to align with P₂, then vertically, the legs of the triangle are:

- •horizontal change (run): x₂ − x₁
- •vertical change (rise): y₂ − y₁

The Pythagorean theorem says:

- •(hypotenuse)² = (leg)² + (leg)²

So the distance d between P₁ and P₂ satisfies:

d² = (x₂ − x₁)² + (y₂ − y₁)²

Take square roots (distance is nonnegative):

d = √((x₂ − x₁)² + (y₂ − y₁)²)

That is the **distance formula**.

### Why the squares matter

Notice that differences can be negative:

- •x₂ − x₁ might be negative
- •y₂ − y₁ might be negative

But distance should never be negative. Squaring removes sign:

- •(−3)² = 9

Then √(…) brings you back to a nonnegative length.

### A useful viewpoint: distance depends on differences

Distance does not depend on the absolute coordinates alone. It depends on the **change**:

- •Δx = x₂ − x₁
- •Δy = y₂ − y₁

Then:

d = √((Δx)² + (Δy)²)

This “difference-first” idea is a major theme in calculus:

- •slope is Δy/Δx
- •derivative is a limit of Δy/Δx as Δx → 0

### Special cases to build intuition

1) Same y-coordinate (horizontal line): y₂ = y₁

Then:

- •d = √((x₂ − x₁)² + 0²) = √((x₂ − x₁)²) = |x₂ − x₁|

So horizontal distance is absolute difference in x.

2) Same x-coordinate (vertical line): x₂ = x₁

Then:

- •d = √(0² + (y₂ − y₁)²) = |y₂ − y₁|

So vertical distance is absolute difference in y.

### Distance and circles (preview)

A circle can be described as:

- •all points (x,y) that are distance r from a center (a,b)

Using the distance formula:

√((x − a)² + (y − b)²) = r

Square both sides (common algebra step):

(x − a)² + (y − b)² = r²

This equation is a gateway to graphing and later to multivariable calculus ideas.

## Application/Connection: From Points to Graphs, Limits, and Slope

### Why this node sits in the calculus category

Calculus studies how quantities change. But to even *talk* about change, you need a way to represent quantities and their relationships.

The coordinate plane lets you represent:

- •an **input** as a horizontal coordinate x
- •an **output** as a vertical coordinate y

Then a relationship becomes a picture.

### Functions as sets of points

A function is often written:

- •y = f(x)

A graph of f is the set of points:

- •(x, f(x))

So once you understand points (x,y), you understand what a graph is: many plotted points following a rule.

Example:

- •If f(x) = x², then points include:
- •(−2, 4)
- •(−1, 1)
- •(0, 0)
- •(1, 1)
- •(2, 4)

You don’t need calculus yet—just coordinate pairs.

### Limits: “x gets close to a” means distance on the number line

In limits, you’ll see language like:

- •“as x approaches a”
- •x → a

This is fundamentally about distance on the x-axis:

- •|x − a| is the distance between x and a on the number line

Even though this node focuses on the plane, the same idea appears:

- •distance in 1D is |x − a|
- •distance in 2D is √((Δx)² + (Δy)²)

So the distance idea you learned here is an early version of measuring “closeness.”

### Slope: rise over run is built from coordinates

Given two points on a line:

- •(x₁, y₁)
- •(x₂, y₂)

The slope m is:

m = (y₂ − y₁) / (x₂ − x₁)

Notice how it uses the same Δy and Δx that appeared in the distance formula. Coordinate geometry is the toolkit; slope is one of the first tools you build from it.

### Vectors (preview) and displacement between points

The displacement from P₁ to P₂ can be represented by a vector:

- •**v** = ⟨x₂ − x₁, y₂ − y₁⟩

Its length (magnitude) matches the distance:

- •‖**v**‖ = √((x₂ − x₁)² + (y₂ − y₁)²)

This shows a deep connection:

- •points give locations
- •vectors give changes between locations

You will use this idea later to describe motion and directional change.

### Practical habit: always label and sanity-check

When working with coordinates, develop two habits:

1) Label axes and units when possible

2) Sanity-check signs and quadrants

If your point is drawn left of the y-axis but you wrote x > 0, something is inconsistent. Catching those small mismatches early saves time later, especially when calculus problems get more algebra-heavy.

## Worked Examples (3)

### Plot and interpret points in different quadrants

You are given three points: A = (3,2), B = (−4,1), C = (−2,−5). For each point, identify its quadrant and describe how to plot it from the origin.

1. Point A = (3,2)

   - •x = 3 > 0 so move 3 units right
   - •y = 2 > 0 so move 2 units up
   - •Signs are (+,+), so A is in Quadrant I
2. Point B = (−4,1)

   - •x = −4 < 0 so move 4 units left
   - •y = 1 > 0 so move 1 unit up
   - •Signs are (−,+), so B is in Quadrant II
3. Point C = (−2,−5)

   - •x = −2 < 0 so move 2 units left
   - •y = −5 < 0 so move 5 units down
   - •Signs are (−,−), so C is in Quadrant III

**Insight:** Quadrants are a fast sign-check: x tells left/right, y tells up/down. Plotting is just “x first, then y.”

### Compute distance between two points using the distance formula

Find the distance between P₁ = (1, −2) and P₂ = (4, 2).

1. Write the coordinate differences:

   Δx = x₂ − x₁ = 4 − 1 = 3

   Δy = y₂ − y₁ = 2 − (−2) = 4
2. Apply the distance formula:

   d = √((Δx)² + (Δy)²)

   = √(3^2 + 4^2)
3. Compute squares and add:

   3^2 = 9

   4^2 = 16

   So d = √(9 + 16) = √25
4. Take the square root:

   d = 5

**Insight:** Distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs are the horizontal and vertical changes (Δx and Δy).

### Derive the distance formula from the Pythagorean theorem

Derive a formula for the distance between P₁ = (x₁, y₁) and P₂ = (x₂, y₂) using a right triangle.

1. Construct a right triangle by drawing a horizontal segment from (x₁,y₁) to (x₂,y₁), then a vertical segment to (x₂,y₂).
2. Identify leg lengths:

   Horizontal leg length = x₂ − x₁ (its magnitude is |x₂ − x₁|)

   Vertical leg length = y₂ − y₁ (its magnitude is |y₂ − y₁|)
3. Apply the Pythagorean theorem to the triangle:

   d² = (horizontal)² + (vertical)²
4. Substitute the coordinate differences:

   d² = (x₂ − x₁)² + (y₂ − y₁)²
5. Take square roots (distance is nonnegative):

   d = √((x₂ − x₁)² + (y₂ − y₁)²)

**Insight:** The squares remove sign issues automatically, so you can use Δx and Δy directly without separately taking absolute values.

## Key Takeaways

- ✓

  A Cartesian coordinate system uses perpendicular axes (x-axis, y-axis) and an origin (0,0) to label points with numbers.
- ✓

  A point is labeled by an ordered pair (x,y); the order matters because x controls horizontal position and y controls vertical position.
- ✓

  Quadrants summarize signs: I (+,+), II (−,+), III (−,−), IV (+,−).
- ✓

  Points on axes have a zero coordinate: (x,0) lies on the x-axis and (0,y) lies on the y-axis.
- ✓

  The distance between (x₁,y₁) and (x₂,y₂) is d = √((x₂−x₁)² + (y₂−y₁)²).
- ✓

  Distance and slope both depend on coordinate differences Δx and Δy, which foreshadow calculus ideas about change.

## Common Mistakes

- ✗

  Swapping coordinates: plotting (x,y) as if it were (y,x).
- ✗

  Forgetting negative directions: moving right for negative x or up for negative y.
- ✗

  Using the distance formula but forgetting to square the differences, or taking √(Δx + Δy) instead of √((Δx)² + (Δy)²).
- ✗

  Mixing up points and vectors: treating a location (x,y) as if it automatically represents a displacement without specifying a start point.

## Practice

easy

Identify the quadrant (or axis) of each point: (−3,4), (5,−2), (0,7), (−1,0).

**Hint:** Use the signs of x and y. If one coordinate is 0, the point lies on an axis.

Show solution

(−3,4) is Quadrant II.

(5,−2) is Quadrant IV.

(0,7) lies on the y-axis.

(−1,0) lies on the x-axis.

medium

Compute the distance between A = (−2,1) and B = (3,−3).

**Hint:** Compute Δx = 3 − (−2) and Δy = −3 − 1, then use d = √((Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2).

Show solution

Δx = 3 − (−2) = 5

Δy = −3 − 1 = −4

d = √(5^2 + (−4)^2)

= √(25 + 16)

= √41

medium

Find all points on the x-axis that are distance 6 from the origin.

**Hint:** Points on the x-axis look like (x,0). Use the distance formula to the origin: √(x^2 + 0^2) = 6.

Show solution

Let the point be (x,0).

Distance to (0,0):

√((x−0)^2 + (0−0)^2) = 6

√(x^2) = 6

|x| = 6

So x = 6 or x = −6.

The points are (6,0) and (−6,0).
