## Core Concepts

- -Slope as a ratio: vertical change divided by horizontal change (rise over run).
- -Sign encodes direction: positive slope means output increases with input, negative means it decreases, zero means no change.
- -Slope as rate: numerical amount of output change per one unit of input (units of output per unit of input).

## Key Symbols & Notation

delta notation: 'delta y' and 'delta x' (words 'delta y'/'delta x' meaning change in y and change in x).

## Essential Relationships

- -slope = (change in y)/(change in x); between two points use (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1).

### Teaching Strategy

Self-serve tutorial - low prerequisites, straightforward concepts.

You’re tracking something that changes: speed, temperature, cost, growth. “Slope” is the simplest numerical tool for describing that change—how much output moves when input moves.

TL;DR:

Slope measures rate of change: slope = (change in y)/(change in x) = “delta y over delta x.” Positive slope means y increases as x increases; negative means it decreases; zero means it stays constant. Units matter: slope has units of “y-units per x-unit.”

## What Is Slope and Rate of Change?

Slope is a number that tells you how steep a line is, and more broadly how quickly one quantity changes relative to another.

### Why we care (motivation before formulas)

A graph often shows a relationship: input → output.

- •Input is usually on the horizontal axis (x).
- •Output is usually on the vertical axis (y).

If x changes, y might change too. Slope answers: **how much does y change when x changes by 1 unit?**

This is the foundation of:

- •**Linear equations** (y = mx + b), where m is the slope.
- •**Derivatives**, which are “instantaneous slope” (slope at a point).

### The core definition (rise over run)

Pick two points on a line:

- •Point 1: (x₁, y₁)
- •Point 2: (x₂, y₂)

Define the changes (“deltas”):

- •delta x = x₂ − x₁ (change in x)
- •delta y = y₂ − y₁ (change in y)

Then the slope m is:

m = (delta y)/(delta x)

People often say:

- •**rise** = delta y
- •**run** = delta x
- •slope = rise/run

### Intuition: “per 1 unit of x”

Suppose m = 3. That means:

- •When x increases by 1, y increases by 3.

If m = −2, that means:

- •When x increases by 1, y decreases by 2.

This “per 1 unit” interpretation is what makes slope a **rate of change**.

### Units: slope is a rate with units

Slope is not just a number; it often carries units.

If y is measured in dollars and x in hours, then:

- •m has units dollars/hour

If y is meters and x is seconds, then:

- •m has units meters/second

That unit interpretation is a big clue for real-world problems.

### A note about vectors (optional perspective)

Sometimes it helps to think of moving from one point to another as a vector.

From (x₁, y₁) to (x₂, y₂) the change is the vector **v** = ⟨delta x, delta y⟩.

Slope is the ratio delta y/delta x, which compares the vertical part to the horizontal part.

### When slope is not defined

If delta x = 0, you’d be dividing by zero. That happens for a vertical line (x is constant).

- •Vertical line: delta x = 0 ⇒ slope is **undefined**

This matches intuition: a vertical line has “infinite steepness,” but we treat its slope as undefined in algebra.

## Core Mechanic 1: Computing Slope from Two Points (delta y / delta x)

Computing slope from two points is the most common skill you’ll use early on. The key is to be consistent and careful with subtraction.

### Why this works

A straight line has a constant steepness. That means no matter which two points you choose on the same line, the ratio (delta y)/(delta x) comes out the same.

### The formula (with careful steps)

Given two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂):

m = (y₂ − y₁)/(x₂ − x₁)

The main idea: **subtract in the same order in numerator and denominator**.

### A “triangle” picture: rise and run

If you move from (x₁, y₁) to (x₂, y₂), you can imagine two moves:

1) Move horizontally from x₁ to x₂ (that’s the run = delta x)

2) Move vertically from y₁ to y₂ (that’s the rise = delta y)

So slope is literally:

- •how much you went up/down
- •divided by how much you went right/left

### Consistency check

If you swap the two points, the slope should not change.

Let’s see why:

m = (y₂ − y₁)/(x₂ − x₁)

If you swap:

m' = (y₁ − y₂)/(x₁ − x₂)

Notice both numerator and denominator are negated:

- •(y₁ − y₂) = −(y₂ − y₁)
- •(x₁ − x₂) = −(x₂ − x₁)

So:

m' = [−(y₂ − y₁)]/[−(x₂ − x₁)]

= (y₂ − y₁)/(x₂ − x₁)

= m

So swapping points doesn’t change slope—good sign.

### Special slopes you should recognize

| Line type | What it looks like | delta y | delta x | Slope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Increasing | goes up as x increases | positive | positive | positive |
| Decreasing | goes down as x increases | negative | positive | negative |
| Horizontal | flat | 0 | nonzero | 0 |
| Vertical | straight up/down | nonzero | 0 | undefined |

### Using slope as a rate

If you can interpret x and y with units, slope becomes a rate.

Example interpretations:

- •If x = time (hours) and y = distance (miles), slope = miles/hour (speed).
- •If x = items and y = cost (dollars), slope = dollars/item (unit price).

### A gentle warning about “steepness”

Bigger |m| means steeper.

- •m = 10 is very steep upward.
- •m = −10 is very steep downward.
- •m = 0.1 is only slightly upward.

The sign tells direction; the magnitude tells steepness.

## Core Mechanic 2: Interpreting Sign, Magnitude, and Units (Slope as Rate)

Computing slope is only half the skill. The other half is interpreting what the number means.

### Why interpretation matters

In many problems, you’re not asked “What is m?” You’re asked what it means:

- •Is something increasing or decreasing?
- •How fast?
- •What does “per unit” refer to?

Slope answers those questions quickly.

### Sign encodes direction

Assume delta x > 0 (you move to the right on the graph). Then:

- •If delta y > 0, slope is positive ⇒ y increases as x increases.
- •If delta y < 0, slope is negative ⇒ y decreases as x increases.
- •If delta y = 0, slope is 0 ⇒ y does not change as x changes.

This is why slope is often called “rate of change.” It measures change and direction.

### Magnitude encodes how fast

Slope compares output change to input change.

- •If m = 5, then every 1 unit of x corresponds to 5 units of y.
- •If m = 0.5, then every 1 unit of x corresponds to 0.5 units of y.

So |m| tells you the speed/steepness of change.

### Units make the meaning precise

Think of slope like this:

m = (delta y)/(delta x) = “(units of y)/(units of x)”

Examples:

- •Temperature change over time: °C/min
- •Pay earned over hours: dollars/hour
- •Height gained over distance walked: meters/km

### Converting “per 1 unit” to “per k units”

If m is the change in y per 1 unit of x, then for k units of x you expect k·m units of y change (for a line).

If m = 3 (units y per unit x), and x increases by 4 units, then:

delta y = m · delta x

= 3 · 4

= 12

This relationship is worth remembering:

delta y = m · delta x

It’s just rearranging the slope formula:

m = (delta y)/(delta x)

⇒ delta y = m · delta x (when delta x ≠ 0)

### Average rate of change vs slope of a line

For a straight line, the slope is constant, so it matches the average rate of change on any interval.

For a curve, the “slope between two points” is still meaningful—it’s called the **average rate of change** between those points:

average rate = (delta y)/(delta x)

This idea is a stepping stone to derivatives (instantaneous rate of change).

### Comparing rates: a quick table

| Context | What is x? | What is y? | Slope means |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Motion | time | distance | speed |
| Finance | time | money | earning/spending rate |
| Physics | time | temperature | heating/cooling rate |
| Business | items | total cost | unit cost |

The structure is always the same: slope is “how much y per x.”

## Application/Connection: From Slope to Lines and to Derivatives

Slope is a hinge concept: it connects basic graph reading to both algebra (lines) and calculus (derivatives).

## Connection A: Linear equations (y = mx + b)

A line can be described by:

y = mx + b

- •m is the slope (rate of change)
- •b is the y-intercept (the value of y when x = 0)

### Why this form is useful

Once you know m and one point, you can build the whole line.

If you know slope m and a point (x₀, y₀), then the line satisfies:

y − y₀ = m(x − x₀)

This is called point-slope form, and it comes directly from the slope definition.

Derivation (showing the connection to delta notation):

Take any point (x, y) on the line and compare it to (x₀, y₀).

m = (y − y₀)/(x − x₀)

Multiply both sides by (x − x₀):

y − y₀ = m(x − x₀)

That’s the equation of the line with slope m through (x₀, y₀).

## Connection B: Derivatives (instantaneous rate of change)

If a graph is curved, the “rate of change” can vary.

- •Between two points, you can still compute average rate:

(delta y)/(delta x)

- •At a single point, you want the **instantaneous** rate.

Calculus defines the derivative using slopes of secant lines (between two points) and then taking a limit as the points get closer.

Even before limits, you can understand the idea:

- •Slope between two points = average rate of change
- •Slope at one point = instantaneous rate of change

So learning slope carefully now makes derivatives feel like a natural next step rather than a new mystery.

## A practical “sense-making” checklist

When you see a slope value, ask:

1) What are the units of x and y?

2) Is the slope positive, negative, or zero?

3) What does “per 1 unit of x” mean in the situation?

4) If x changes by 5, what change in y should you expect (for a line)?

This turns slope from a formula into a tool.

## Worked Examples (3)

### Slope from two points (basic computation)

Find the slope of the line through points (2, 3) and (6, 11). Interpret what the slope means as “per 1 unit of x.”

1. Label the points:

   (x₁, y₁) = (2, 3)

   (x₂, y₂) = (6, 11)
2. Compute changes:

   delta x = x₂ − x₁ = 6 − 2 = 4

   delta y = y₂ − y₁ = 11 − 3 = 8
3. Compute slope:

   m = (delta y)/(delta x) = 8/4 = 2
4. Interpretation:

   m = 2 means that for every increase of 1 in x, y increases by 2 (on this line).

**Insight:** A slope of 2 is a constant rate: the line rises 2 units for every 1 unit it runs to the right.

### Negative and zero slope (direction matters)

Compute the slopes for: A) (1, 5) to (4, 2) and B) (−3, 7) to (2, 7).

1. A) Use (x₁, y₁) = (1, 5), (x₂, y₂) = (4, 2)

   delta x = 4 − 1 = 3

   delta y = 2 − 5 = −3

   m = (delta y)/(delta x) = (−3)/3 = −1
2. Interpret A:

   m = −1 means that when x increases by 1, y decreases by 1.
3. B) Use (x₁, y₁) = (−3, 7), (x₂, y₂) = (2, 7)

   delta x = 2 − (−3) = 5

   delta y = 7 − 7 = 0

   m = 0/5 = 0
4. Interpret B:

   m = 0 means y does not change as x changes; this is a horizontal line.

**Insight:** The sign of slope captures direction: negative slopes go down to the right; zero slope is flat.

### Slope as a real-world rate with units

A taxi charges a base fee plus a constant rate per mile. Over a trip, the cost goes from $9 to $21 as distance goes from 2 miles to 8 miles. Compute the slope and interpret its units.

1. Identify variables:

   Let x = miles (distance)

   Let y = dollars (cost)
2. Compute changes:

   delta x = 8 − 2 = 6 miles

   delta y = 21 − 9 = 12 dollars
3. Compute slope:

   m = (delta y)/(delta x) = 12/6 = 2
4. Attach units:

   Slope units = dollars/mile
5. Interpretation:

   m = 2 dollars/mile means each additional mile increases cost by $2 (a constant per-mile rate).

**Insight:** Slope naturally produces “per” units. Here it reveals the per-mile price, separate from any base fee.

## Key Takeaways

- ✓

  Slope measures rate of change: m = (delta y)/(delta x) = rise/run.
- ✓

  delta y means “change in y” and delta x means “change in x.”
- ✓

  Positive slope ⇒ y increases as x increases; negative slope ⇒ y decreases; zero slope ⇒ y stays constant.
- ✓

  Slope has units: (units of y)/(units of x), like dollars/hour or meters/second.
- ✓

  For a line, slope is constant no matter which two points you pick on that line.
- ✓

  Horizontal lines have slope 0; vertical lines have undefined slope because delta x = 0.
- ✓

  Rearranging m = (delta y)/(delta x) gives delta y = m · delta x, useful for predicting change.

## Common Mistakes

- ✗

  Swapping subtraction order in only one place (e.g., using y₂ − y₁ but x₁ − x₂), which flips the sign incorrectly.
- ✗

  Forgetting that vertical lines have undefined slope (division by zero), not “0 slope.”
- ✗

  Ignoring units and interpreting slope backwards (mixing up “per x” vs “per y”).
- ✗

  Confusing steepness with y-value: a line can have a high y-intercept but small slope, or vice versa.

## Practice

easy

Find the slope of the line through (−2, 4) and (3, −1).

**Hint:** Compute delta y = y₂ − y₁ and delta x = x₂ − x₁, then divide.

Show solution

Let (x₁, y₁) = (−2, 4), (x₂, y₂) = (3, −1).

delta x = 3 − (−2) = 5

delta y = −1 − 4 = −5

m = (delta y)/(delta x) = (−5)/5 = −1

medium

A tank is being filled at a constant rate. Volume increases from 30 liters to 54 liters over 6 minutes. What is the slope, and what does it mean?

**Hint:** Treat time as x and volume as y. Use m = (delta y)/(delta x) and attach units.

Show solution

Let x = minutes and y = liters.

delta y = 54 − 30 = 24 liters

delta x = 6 minutes

m = 24/6 = 4 liters/min

Meaning: the tank’s volume increases by 4 liters each minute.

medium

A line is horizontal and passes through (10, −3). What is its slope? If x changes by 8, what is delta y?

**Hint:** Horizontal means y is constant, so delta y = 0 for any delta x.

Show solution

Horizontal line ⇒ slope m = 0.

If delta x = 8, then delta y = m · delta x = 0 · 8 = 0. So y does not change.
