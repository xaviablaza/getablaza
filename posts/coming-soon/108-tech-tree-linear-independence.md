- - linear combination: an expression a1·v1 + a2·v2 + ... + an·vn with scalars ai and vectors vi
- - trivial linear combination: the linear combination where all coefficients ai = 0
- - nontrivial linear combination: a linear combination in which at least one coefficient ai ≠ 0
- - linear dependence: a set of vectors is dependent if there exists a nontrivial linear combination equal to the zero vector
- - linear independence: a set of vectors is independent if the only linear combination that gives the zero vector is the trivial one
- - dependence witness: a specific choice of coefficients (not all zero) demonstrating linear dependence
- - redundancy (in a dependent set): at least one vector in the set can be written in terms of the others
- - independence of a singleton: a single vector {v} is independent iff v ≠ 0

### Teaching Strategy

Self-serve tutorial - low prerequisites, straightforward concepts.

When you collect vectors, you’re often asking: “Do these vectors actually give me new directions, or are some of them redundant?” Linear independence is the precise way to measure redundancy.

TL;DR:

A set of vectors {**v**₁,…,**v**ₙ} is linearly independent if the only way to make the zero vector from them is the trivial linear combination: c₁**v**₁ + … + cₙ**v**ₙ = **0** implies c₁ = … = cₙ = 0. If there is a nontrivial solution, the set is dependent (some vector is a linear combination of the others).

## What Is Linear Independence?

### Why we care (before the definition)

In a vector space, vectors represent “directions” or “features.” But sets of vectors can contain repetition in disguise: one vector might be obtainable from the others.

Linear independence answers a basic structural question:

- •**Are all vectors contributing something new?**
- •Or is at least one vector **redundant** because it can be built from the rest?

This matters immediately for:

- •**Solving linear systems** (unique vs multiple solutions)
- •**Coordinates** (whether a representation is unique)
- •**Bases** (minimal building blocks of a space)

### Linear combinations (the raw material)

Given vectors **v**₁,…,**v**ₙ in a vector space V and scalars c₁,…,cₙ, a **linear combination** is

c₁**v**₁ + c₂**v**₂ + … + cₙ**v**ₙ.

The special case where all coefficients are zero,

0·**v**₁ + 0·**v**₂ + … + 0·**v**ₙ = **0**,

is called the **trivial linear combination**. It always exists, for every set of vectors.

### Definition (canonical equation)

A set of vectors {**v**₁,…,**v**ₙ} is **linearly independent** if the only solution to

c₁**v**₁ + c₂**v**₂ + … + cₙ**v**ₙ = **0**

is

c₁ = c₂ = … = cₙ = 0.

If there exists a solution where **at least one coefficient is nonzero**, then the set is **linearly dependent**.

### Intuition: “no cancellations except the obvious”

Think of c₁**v**₁ + … + cₙ**v**ₙ as trying to “cancel” vectors to land exactly on **0**.

- •If the only way to cancel to zero is to use all zero weights, then no vector can be synthesized from the others.
- •If you can cancel to zero using some nonzero weights, then there is redundancy.

### Equivalent redundancy viewpoint

A very useful equivalent statement (we’ll justify it carefully later):

> {**v**₁,…,**v**ₙ} is linearly dependent ⇔ at least one vector is a linear combination of the others.

This is the “redundancy detector” version: dependency means one vector can be removed without losing the span.

### Small geometric pictures (without handwaving)

In ℝ²:

- •One nonzero vector is independent by itself.
- •Two vectors are independent if they are **not multiples** of each other (not collinear).
- •Three vectors in ℝ² must be dependent (there isn’t room for three independent directions).

In ℝ³:

- •Two vectors are independent if they are not collinear.
- •Three vectors are independent if they don’t all lie in the same plane through the origin (equivalently, determinant ≠ 0 if you place them as columns of a 3×3 matrix).

## Core Mechanic 1: Using the Zero-Combination Test (Solve for the coefficients)

### Why this is the core test

The definition of linear independence is written as a single equation:

c₁**v**₁ + … + cₙ**v**ₙ = **0**.

So the most direct way to test independence is:

1) Write the equation component-wise (or as a matrix equation).

2) Solve for the scalars c₁,…,cₙ.

3) Check whether the only solution is the trivial one.

This method is universal: it works in any vector space where you can express vectors with respect to some coordinates (or where you can otherwise solve the relation).

### Converting to a matrix equation

Suppose **v**₁,…,**v**ₙ are in ℝᵐ. Put them as columns of a matrix A:

A = [ **v**₁ **v**₂ … **v**ₙ ] (an m×n matrix)

Then

c₁**v**₁ + … + cₙ**v**ₙ = **0**

is the same as

A**c** = **0**,

where **c** = (c₁,…,cₙ) is the coefficient vector.

So:

- •The vectors are **independent** ⇔ the homogeneous system A**c** = **0** has only the trivial solution.
- •The vectors are **dependent** ⇔ A**c** = **0** has a nontrivial solution.

### Row-reduction viewpoint

Row reducing A does not change the solution set of A**c** = **0** (it produces an equivalent system). So independence becomes a rank/pivot question:

- •If every column of A has a pivot (i.e., there are n pivot columns), then **c** = **0** is the only solution ⇒ independent.
- •If at least one column is free (non-pivot), there are infinitely many solutions ⇒ dependent.

### A key pacing note: “only solution” is the whole game

Many learners hear “linear independence” and look for a quick geometric shortcut even when one isn’t available. The safest mental model is:

> Independence is about **uniqueness of coefficients** in the zero relation.

If the zero vector can be produced in more than one way (i.e., with a nonzero coefficient vector), then some nontrivial cancellation exists.

### Quick necessary conditions (sanity checks)

These don’t replace the test, but help you predict outcomes.

1) **If one vector is the zero vector**

If some **v**ᵢ = **0**, then the set is dependent because

1·**v**ᵢ = **0**

is a nontrivial combination.

2) **Too many vectors for the ambient dimension**

In ℝᵐ, any set of more than m vectors is dependent.

Reason (informal for now, formal later with dimension): you cannot have more than m independent directions in m-dimensional space.

3) **Obvious multiples**

If **v**₂ = k**v**₁ for some scalar k, then

k**v**₁ − 1·**v**₂ = **0**

is nontrivial ⇒ dependent.

### Independence vs orthogonality (don’t conflate)

Orthogonal nonzero vectors are always independent, but independence does **not** require orthogonality.

| Concept | What it constrains | Typical test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linear independence | No nontrivial combination equals **0** | Solve A**c**=**0**, pivots |
| Orthogonality | Dot products are 0 between distinct vectors | **v**ᵢ·**v**ⱼ = 0 |

You can have independent vectors that are not orthogonal (common in real data and features).

## Core Mechanic 2: Equivalence to “One Vector is a Combination of the Others”

### Why this equivalence is powerful

The definition uses **all** vectors simultaneously:

c₁**v**₁ + … + cₙ**v**ₙ = **0**.

But in practice you often want a more “local” redundancy statement:

- •“Is **v**ₖ determined by the others?”
- •“Can I remove a vector without changing what I can build?”

That’s exactly what the equivalence gives.

### Claim

A set {**v**₁,…,**v**ₙ} is linearly dependent **iff** at least one vector can be written as a linear combination of the others.

We’ll prove both directions with careful algebra.

### (⇒) Dependence implies redundancy

Assume the set is dependent.

Then there exist scalars c₁,…,cₙ, not all zero, such that

c₁**v**₁ + c₂**v**₂ + … + cₙ**v**ₙ = **0**.

Because not all coefficients are zero, pick an index k with cₖ ≠ 0.

Now isolate **v**ₖ:

c₁**v**₁ + … + cₖ**v**ₖ + … + cₙ**v**ₙ = **0**

cₖ**v**ₖ = −(c₁**v**₁ + … + cₖ₋₁**v**ₖ₋₁ + cₖ₊₁**v**ₖ₊₁ + … + cₙ**v**ₙ)

**v**ₖ = −(c₁/cₖ)**v**₁ − … − (cₖ₋₁/cₖ)**v**ₖ₋₁ − (cₖ₊₁/cₖ)**v**ₖ₊₁ − … − (cₙ/cₖ)**v**ₙ.

So **v**ₖ is a linear combination of the other vectors. Redundancy found.

### (⇐) Redundancy implies dependence

Conversely, assume some vector is a combination of the others. Say

**v**ₖ = a₁**v**₁ + … + aₖ₋₁**v**ₖ₋₁ + aₖ₊₁**v**ₖ₊₁ + … + aₙ**v**ₙ.

Bring everything to one side:

**v**ₖ − a₁**v**₁ − … − aₖ₋₁**v**ₖ₋₁ − aₖ₊₁**v**ₖ₊₁ − … − aₙ**v**ₙ = **0**.

This is a linear combination equaling **0** with coefficient 1 on **v**ₖ, so it’s nontrivial. Therefore the set is dependent.

### Two practical consequences

1) **If the set is dependent, you can remove at least one vector without changing the span.**

Because a dependent vector is already “covered” by the rest.

2) **Independence implies uniqueness of representation (relative to that set).**

If a vector **x** can be written as

**x** = c₁**v**₁ + … + cₙ**v**ₙ

and also as

**x** = d₁**v**₁ + … + dₙ**v**ₙ,

subtract:

**0** = (c₁−d₁)**v**₁ + … + (cₙ−dₙ)**v**ₙ.

If {**v**ᵢ} are independent, then cᵢ−dᵢ = 0 for all i ⇒ cᵢ = dᵢ.

So the coefficients are unique.

This is a key bridge to coordinates and bases: if a set is a basis, you want every vector to have **exactly one** coordinate representation.

## Application/Connection: From Independence to Basis and Dimension

### Why independence is the gatekeeper for “building blocks”

A basis of a vector space is meant to be:

- •**Enough** vectors to build everything (spanning)
- •**No extra** vectors (independent)

Independence supplies the “no extra” part.

### Minimal spanning sets

Suppose S = {**v**₁,…,**v**ₙ} spans a space (or subspace) W.

- •If S is dependent, then at least one vector is redundant, so S is not minimal.
- •If S is independent and spans W, then it’s a basis for W.

So the workflow to find a basis often looks like:

1) Start with some spanning set.

2) Remove dependent vectors (using row reduction / pivot columns).

3) What remains is independent and still spans.

### Linear systems: uniqueness and free variables

The independence test A**c**=**0** is a homogeneous linear system.

- •Independent columns ⇒ the only solution is **c**=**0** ⇒ no free variables.
- •Dependent columns ⇒ at least one free variable ⇒ infinitely many solutions.

This directly parallels solving A**x**=**b**:

- •If columns of A are independent and A is square (n×n), then solutions (when they exist) tend to be unique.
- •If columns are dependent, you expect either no solution or multiple solutions depending on **b**.

### Feature design intuition (machine learning connection)

In data matrices, columns often represent features.

- •If one feature column is a linear combination of others, you have perfect multicollinearity.
- •This can make parameters non-identifiable: different coefficient vectors produce the same predictions.

Independence is the clean mathematical form of “no feature is exactly redundant.”

### A preview of dimension

A deep fact (formalized in the next node) is:

- •In an m-dimensional space, any independent set has size ≤ m.
- •Every basis has exactly m vectors.

So independence is the counting principle that makes “dimension” meaningful.

If you internalize one guiding sentence:

> Independence means “every vector added increases the number of available directions.”

Basis and dimension make that sentence precise.

## Worked Examples (3)

### Example 1: Test independence in ℝ² by solving the zero-combination equation

Let **v**₁ = (1, 2) and **v**₂ = (3, 6). Determine whether {**v**₁, **v**₂} is linearly independent.

1. Start from the definition:

   c₁**v**₁ + c₂**v**₂ = **0**.
2. Write in coordinates:

   c₁(1,2) + c₂(3,6) = (0,0).
3. Add component-wise:

   (c₁ + 3c₂, 2c₁ + 6c₂) = (0,0).
4. Equate components to get a system:

   c₁ + 3c₂ = 0

   2c₁ + 6c₂ = 0
5. Notice the second equation is just 2× the first, so there are infinitely many solutions.

   Solve the first:

   c₁ = −3c₂.
6. Pick a nonzero value, e.g. c₂ = 1 ⇒ c₁ = −3.

   Then:

   (−3)**v**₁ + 1·**v**₂ = **0**

   so the combination is nontrivial.

**Insight:** The set is dependent because **v**₂ = 3**v**₁. In ℝ², two vectors are independent exactly when they are not scalar multiples.

### Example 2: Use a matrix and row reduction (pivot columns) in ℝ³

Let **v**₁ = (1,0,1), **v**₂ = (2,1,0), **v**₃ = (3,1,1). Test whether {**v**₁, **v**₂, **v**₃} is linearly independent.

1. Form the matrix with these as columns:

   A = [ **v**₁ **v**₂ **v**₃ ] =

   ⎡1 2 3⎤

   ⎢0 1 1⎥

   ⎣1 0 1⎦
2. We test A**c** = **0**. Row-reduce A.

   Start with:

   ⎡1 2 3⎤

   ⎢0 1 1⎥

   ⎣1 0 1⎦
3. Eliminate the 1 under the first pivot (Row3 ← Row3 − Row1):

   Row3: (1,0,1) − (1,2,3) = (0, −2, −2)

   So we have:

   ⎡1 2 3⎤

   ⎢0 1 1⎥

   ⎣0 −2 −2⎦
4. Make Row3 simpler (Row3 ← (−1/2)Row3):

   Row3 becomes (0,1,1)

   ⎡1 2 3⎤

   ⎢0 1 1⎥

   ⎣0 1 1⎦
5. Now subtract Row2 from Row3 (Row3 ← Row3 − Row2):

   Row3 becomes (0,0,0)

   ⎡1 2 3⎤

   ⎢0 1 1⎥

   ⎣0 0 0⎦
6. A row of zeros means we have fewer than 3 pivots, so at least one free variable in A**c**=**0** ⇒ nontrivial solutions exist ⇒ dependent.

**Insight:** Row3 becoming zero means one column is a linear combination of the others. In fact **v**₃ = **v**₁ + **v**₂ because (1,0,1) + (2,1,0) = (3,1,1).

### Example 3: Independence implies unique coefficients (a short proof by subtraction)

Assume {**v**₁, **v**₂, **v**₃} is linearly independent. Suppose a vector **x** has two representations:

**x** = c₁**v**₁ + c₂**v**₂ + c₃**v**₃

**x** = d₁**v**₁ + d₂**v**₂ + d₃**v**₃.

Show that cᵢ = dᵢ for all i.

1. Subtract the two equations:

   **x** − **x** = (c₁**v**₁ + c₂**v**₂ + c₃**v**₃) − (d₁**v**₁ + d₂**v**₂ + d₃**v**₃).
2. Simplify left side:

   **0** = (c₁−d₁)**v**₁ + (c₂−d₂)**v**₂ + (c₃−d₃)**v**₃.
3. This is a linear combination equaling **0**.

   Because the set is independent, the only solution is the trivial one:

   c₁−d₁ = 0

   c₂−d₂ = 0

   c₃−d₃ = 0.
4. Therefore:

   c₁ = d₁, c₂ = d₂, c₃ = d₃.

**Insight:** Independence is exactly the condition needed for “coordinates” in a set of vectors to be well-defined (unique). This is why bases must be independent.

## Key Takeaways

- ✓

  Linear independence means: c₁**v**₁ + … + cₙ**v**ₙ = **0** ⇒ c₁ = … = cₙ = 0.
- ✓

  Linear dependence means there exists a nontrivial coefficient choice making the zero vector: some cancellation is possible.
- ✓

  Dependency is equivalent to redundancy: at least one vector can be written as a linear combination of the others.
- ✓

  To test independence in ℝᵐ, put vectors as columns of A and solve A**c**=**0** (row reduce; check for pivots in every column).
- ✓

  If a set contains **0**, it is automatically dependent.
- ✓

  In ℝᵐ, any set of more than m vectors must be dependent (there isn’t enough dimension).
- ✓

  If vectors are independent, representations in terms of them are unique (subtract two representations to get a zero-combination).

## Common Mistakes

- ✗

  Thinking “independent” means “orthogonal.” Orthogonality implies independence (if vectors are nonzero), but independence does not require right angles.
- ✗

  Checking only one equation/component and concluding dependence or independence; you must satisfy the full vector equation (all components).
- ✗

  Assuming that because vectors ‘look different’ they must be independent; dependence can be subtle (e.g., **v**₃ = **v**₁ + **v**₂).
- ✗

  Forgetting that the trivial combination always exists, and mistakenly calling a set dependent because c₁=…=cₙ=0 solves the equation.

## Practice

easy

Decide whether {**v**₁, **v**₂} is linearly independent in ℝ², where **v**₁ = (2, −1) and **v**₂ = (−4, 2).

**Hint:** Check whether one vector is a scalar multiple of the other. If **v**₂ = k**v**₁ for some k, the set is dependent.

Show solution

**v**₂ = (−4, 2) = (−2)(2, −1) = (−2)**v**₁. So (−2)**v**₁ − 1·**v**₂ = **0** is nontrivial ⇒ the set is linearly dependent.

medium

Test whether **v**₁ = (1,1,0), **v**₂ = (0,1,1), **v**₃ = (1,2,1) are linearly independent in ℝ³.

**Hint:** Place them as columns of A and row-reduce, or try to see if **v**₃ = **v**₁ + **v**₂.

Show solution

Observe **v**₁ + **v**₂ = (1,1,0) + (0,1,1) = (1,2,1) = **v**₃. Therefore **v**₃ − **v**₁ − **v**₂ = **0** is a nontrivial linear combination ⇒ the set is linearly dependent.

medium

Let **v**₁, **v**₂, **v**₃ be vectors in a vector space V. Suppose **v**₁ and **v**₂ are linearly independent, and **v**₃ = 5**v**₁ − 2**v**₂. Is {**v**₁, **v**₂, **v**₃} linearly independent?

**Hint:** Use the redundancy equivalence: if one vector is a linear combination of the others, the set is dependent.

Show solution

Because **v**₃ is explicitly a linear combination of **v**₁ and **v**₂, the set {**v**₁, **v**₂, **v**₃} is linearly dependent. A nontrivial zero relation is **v**₃ − 5**v**₁ + 2**v**₂ = **0**.
