NEW YORK (November 21, 2023) – Today is mom’s 2nd death anniversary, and she had always said, “the future is now.” I've tried to figure out what that meant. The last 10 years of my mom’s life was a battle, and as I move closer to the future, I remind myself to always stay in battle. To stay uncomfortable, to learn, and to never be complacent. I write this for the sons who have lost their parents.

It is your duty and your responsibility to perform to your utmost ability to respect those who have raised you to be the person you are today through incredible achievement. As her progeny, I do this for honor and pride. You are in this battle against the enemy in your life because once you have your life together, once you're truly proud, and you're truly strong and your finances are strong, and you think for yourself, once you resist other’s opinions, then you're automatically winning the war.

The battle is always with your future problems. You’re fighting with your wife who doesn’t love you anymore, you’re fighting with your own depression, you either fight against yourself and your shame because you have caved to the opinions of other people and their programming, or you resist the opinions of others so you can chart your own, self-righteous path. The reason why I’m fighting is because I don’t want the other side. I don’t believe in it. I refuse to cower and cuck and let my mind be poisoned. Yes, I’m gonna take a lot of flak to do that but I don’t see any other choice, and that’s why I’m here and I’m doing these things.

I’m going to talk about my mother and her origins. One of the reasons I want to do this is because I love the idea of one day perhaps, 50 years from now, one of my sons writes the same thing about me telling the things I used to say and how I built the castle with a moat so large, impervious to attack. That would be a long and interesting story. But we’re going to start from the absolute beginning. Mom was a kind and caring person who took care of us, me, my brother, and my sister as an accomplished dentist. She would pursue hobbies as if they were her professions and tried her very best to master them to the best of her ability. It is only right for me to honor the sacrifice that she went through for us, and it is our responsibility to not ruin the opportunity and the life she has given us.

Her advice was this, “get to know more people and choose who would be best to support you in your current and future endeavors. When I say ‘support’ – find people who see importance in what you do and share your passion and interest in what you’re doing.” I interpret that advice like this: for people to see importance then it is necessary to be important. I also think that getting there doesn't require you to be happy. I don't even think happiness is the end goal. Being proud, courageous, and brave to embark on the journey of being important is what matters more.

She died in hospice, fighting unnecessary battles. The problems brought upon her were not of her own. I believe she is blameless. This was the worst possible death I could have wished for her. I know she is still out there in one of the many variations of the universe looking down on me and I know she's exceptionally proud of me, and that's important to me.

I need to fight against nearly any enemy on the planet and I do not ever feel fear. I have a solution to all problems that life will give me. I do not fear anybody because I have an unlimited source of energy because I am true to my name, have respect for my lineage, and I know I'm a good person and I'm true to my duty with God.

If your enemy is attempting to manipulate you, and you refuse it, they're trying to tell you a lie and when you refuse to listen, then you don't know what their end goal was. You don't know what they were trying to make you believe. You'd say, “I don't want to hear it,” and you’d walk away. You didn't even have the warning in the first place to know that your enemy was trying to manipulate you into believing this.

The correct course of action is exactly as my mother said. I need a mask. You want to believe what your enemies are saying, and they may be very persuasive. They may have evidence. So you need to understand that you need to allow them to manipulate you, or you don't know what their end goal is. Once you know their intention, raw action solves everything. Caution breeds fear now, and this can be applied in so many different ways. She is absolutely and undoubtedly correct. Who has a strong network all around the world, who can still manage to get his signal out, despite what the enemy says? 

When you look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself who is leading me the way I act? Who told you about the opinions you have? Do they have your best interests at heart? Everybody is trying to manipulate you into doing something. Everybody is influencing you to some degree so much of life is designed around the lowest common denominator. The things that I believe may apply to the exceptional, but it doesn't apply to the average person. You can only move as fast as the slowest person.

Unfortunately, we live in a world where money is super important. You can't have an opinion if you're broke because you need to rely on your job. If you truly want to be able to think for yourself and talk for yourself you need to acquire money. The richer the people who believe in me are, the richer my circle are, the more powerful we are. I understand that same reason in my life. I need a team who has the capability to understand what I'm saying. It needs to become exceptional. That means becoming strong and rich. When you have an unwavering belief that you will become strong, and if you have no doubt about it, you would have unlimited potential and would never not believe in yourself.


I end this with an exerpt of Psalm 91:

Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.

I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.”

Surely he will save you from the fowler’s snare and from the deadly pestilence.

He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.

You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day,

nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday.

A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.

You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked.
