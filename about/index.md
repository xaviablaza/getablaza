I'm a technology-focused, entrepreneur characterized by my willingness to do unnecessarily risky things just to teach myself hard lessons. I intentionally make my life difficult, when it could be easy. I mainly study how to brainwash myself to believe certain things about the world.

I like to experiment on how perception control can persuade people to think different things about you. Most things boil down to how your social media looks to other people, what kind of clothes you wear, the accent that you normally operate in, the languages you speak, the vocabulary and idioms you use, and your personal network of those you associate with and trust.

I live in a 1 bedroom apartment in Bangkok, do a bunch of work at Hostari, and eat steaks almost everyday. Most of the things that I do in different cities largely remains the same, whether that's in San Francisco, Chicago, New York, or Manila. I never quite understood why the global prejudice for Filipinos were just call center agents and nurses. So, when I was 24 and since then, I have made it my goal to create a legacy technology empire that will prevent less Filipinos from going overseas to do some bullshit job that they don't even like. People who do not do very intelligent work will be replaced by work bots one day and I think it's important for people to become intelligent.

I optimize my life for optionality, and I mainly do the things I do to prove to my ancestors that my opinion is forthright, correct, and the most truthful way to go about life.
