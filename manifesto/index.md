I believe that founders should strive to keep control of their companies for as long as possible, by fully owning every decision that is made to drive the company forward.

I prefer to share my experiences to trusted and vetted teammates so that we can create amazing outcomes because of the diversity in perspective.

I believe that the strategies that are used to ascend in the world are dependent on where you are born in the world and your upbringing.

I believe that there is no silver bullet, winning strategy that works for every circumstance because everybody's life is unique.

I believe that people should seriously question the agendas of those they are learning from, and seek to form their own virtuous opinions about the world.

I believe that actionable strategies are learned and taught by someone and are hardly invented.

I believe that most thought leadership doesn't drive much value and is used to boost people's egos more than anything.

It is acceptable to be egotistic when you know that your actions will lead to incredibly positive outcomes.

People must have the vital need to shape their goals around discipline in all things.

I believe that to be strong in your mind, you must also be strong in your body, and it is important to train everyday.

I believe that in order to become a hero, you must clearly define who you are fighting against.

I declare war on my enemies and seek to make the best moves possible for myself to reduce their advantages in the battlefield.

I believe that your word is your bond.

I choose to only interact with those who are respectful and civil in return for my own respect and civility.

I believe that it is important to respect your ancestors and to work tirelessly to make them proud.

I am proud of my last name because I honor those who raised me.

I would rather deal with the fear of being known, than being unknown and forgotten.

If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.
